# AgriAssist SMS

AgriAssist SMS is an AI-powered, multilingual advisory platform designed to empower farmers by delivering critical, real-time information directly to their mobile phones via SMS. It bridges the digital divide by providing actionable insights on weather, crop health, and market prices, helping farmers make informed decisions, increase yield, and improve their livelihoods.

The platform features two distinct portals: an **Admin Portal** for registering farmers and managing alerts, and a **Farmer Portal** that provides a localized, user-friendly interface for farmers to access information themselves.

## Key Features

- **Farmer Registration & Management**: Admins can register farmers with details like location, phone number, and primary/secondary crops.
- **AI-Powered Weather Forecasts**: Get concise, actionable weather summaries for any location, translated into the farmer's preferred language.
- **AI Crop Health Diagnosis**: Upload a photo of a plant to get an AI-driven diagnosis of potential diseases or pests, along with recommended actions.
- **Advisory & Pest Alerts**: Admins can generate and broadcast critical alerts about potential threats like pest infestations or adverse weather events.
- **Real-Time Market Prices**: Access live mandi (market) rates for a wide variety of crops to help farmers decide the best time to sell.
- **Multilingual Support**: All information and alerts can be translated into 10 different Indian languages, with both text and voice (Text-to-Speech) output.
- **SMS Integration**: Powered by Twilio, the platform delivers all generated insights directly to any mobile phone, ensuring accessibility for all farmers.
- **AI Chat Assistant**: A knowledgeable chatbot that can answer farming-related questions about weather, market prices, crop diseases, and more.
- **Government ID Verification**: An AI-powered tool to verify a farmer's identity by scanning their government-issued ID card.

## How It Works

1.  **Register Farmer**: An administrator or field agent registers a farmer using the dashboard, capturing their location, crops, and preferred language. The system includes an AI-powered ID verification step for authenticity.
2.  **Generate Insight**: Using the various tools, the admin can generate a weather forecast, a crop diagnosis from a photo, or a pest advisory alert. The information is tailored to the farmer's context.
3.  **Translate & Send SMS**: The generated insight is translated into the farmer's local language and sent directly to their registered mobile number as an SMS. The farmer can also listen to the message using the Text-to-Speech feature in the portal.
